Quick-n-dirty instructions for updating our SWIG version.

* Clone ssh://git.oslo.osa/var/git/tools/swig.git for our patched swig

* Add https://github.com/swig/swig.git as remote and fetch

* Create and rebase our latest patch branch from tools/swig onto the
  new version from github. Our branch on tools/swig is called
  rel-n.n.n-WAM where n.n.n is the SWIG version number. The release
  tags from the swig github repo are called rel-\d+\.\d+\.\d+ Make
  sure to find out what changes are still applicable.

* Download PCRE: http://www.pcre.org/

* Build a static version of PCRE and install to a temporary prefix:
  mkdir /tmp/pcre
  ./configure --prefix=/tmp/pcre/ --enable-shared=no
  make -j8 install

* Build SWIG with the static version of PCRE. We must statically compile PCRE
  as different distributions will name the shared library differently.
  (./autogen.sh)
  ./configure --with-pcre-prefix=/tmp/pcre/
  make -j8

* Copy SWIG to the opera source directory:
    strip -o path-to-opera-work/mobile/tools/swig/swig swig
    cd Lib/
    cp -r *.i *.swg java/ std/ typemaps/ path-to-opera-work/mobile/tools/swig/Lib/

* Build project and find out whats broken. Any changes to swig itself
  is done to tools/swig.
